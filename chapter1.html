            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The world shifts irrevocably on a quiet midsummer eve, and nothing is quite the same ever again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sky, pitch-black, looms over a quiet, nondescript, off-white two-storey facility in the outskirts of town. This night,
                the sky does not let a single star’s light pass through. It is as if the town has been painted over with a brush of perfect night, covering it with a lonely, almost oppressive aura of stillness, somehow dimming every source of light in the air..
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also not natural.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the rooftop of an office building near the off-white facility, two individuals, one male and one female, sprint noiselessly
                towards their target.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Two blocks away.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                They are dressed in black tactical gear. Perched on the right shoulder of the female is a worn, ragged cloth doll cloaked
                in dark ethereal mist. The doll’s head is tilted all the way back, its smiling mouth open and facing the
                sky. The way the little doll grips on to the female and holds on as she moves leaves no doubt that it is
                sentient. A Banette. Shadow-like tendrils emanate from the its open mouth, filling the area with an eerie
                dark hue. By extending its cursed life energy out into its vicinity, it now mutes all sound in the area.
                Not fully, but enough. If a casual observer were in the area, it would be as if he was listening to the world
                through large wads of cotton stuffed in his ears, sound distorting such that a glass pane shattering would
                sound no louder than a coin dropping on the floor. The darkness also disrupts the electric grid and radio
                signals in the air, ensuring the Porygon-Securi-Net monitoring the area is effectively blind. To the outside
                world, these two individuals are nothing more than ghosts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reaching the precipice of the office building, they jump, land, and roll effortlessly, barely breaking their stride. These
                are practiced movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>One block.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The male thumbs a pokeball in his palm, releasing a dark purple Crobat into their midst. Its sleek, aerodynamic profile is
                barely visible in the night. The Crobat immediately darts forward without any further prompting from its
                trainer. The Pokemon have been briefed. It knows what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the edge of this building, the off-white facility finally comes into view. By this time all occupants are long gone. All
                the lights are off, save for one in the lower left corner of the compound, a lone on-duty guard paid to spend
                the night. A guard who’d been bribed to stay out of the way. All that separates the individuals from their
                target now is a street, 5 meters across. The male does not try to halt, or arrest his forward momentum. He
                reaches the edge and leaps. He crests in the air for two precious seconds, hanging, falling, before feeling
                the Crobat’s hind claws find their grip on the designated hooks on the back of his tactical vest. The Crobat
                delivers him the rest of the way across the street, to a second storey window of the facility. Using the
                razor sharp edge of its front wing, it carves out a circular hole in the glass and deposits the male inside.
                Seconds later, the female is dropped in as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Target reached.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Returning the Crobat to its ball, the male takes the time to survey the room they have entered. It is an office area, with
                rows and rows of cubicles stretching from one end of the room to the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                ”I still think we should have brought the Houndooms,” says the male in clipped tones, as the female walks briskly towards
                the door. “They would give us a nice fall-back plan.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Too much liability, remember? The boss would never agree. Besides, we have the building plans and staff list. No need for
                combat,” replies the female.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their voices are muted, muffled, yet the two individuals converse effortlessly, with a familiarity borne only from years
                of experience working together. Navigating the maze of white-tiled corridors, they come to a large, formidable
                looking door of reinforced metal. It is a stark contrast to the other cheap plywood doors they have passed
                this far. The female reaches into a vest pocket, pulls out an access card and swipes it at the card reader
                beside the door. They have come prepared. With an inaudible beep, the door opens, revealing rows of incredibly
                high-grade computing hardware. One could probably buy small countries with the amount of money invested in
                this room. Each going to different terminals, they insert flash-drives and proceed to transfer terabytes
                of data from the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exactly three minutes and fifty-seven seconds after entering, the two individuals slip out the way they came. At four minutes
                and seven seconds, the entire second storey of the facility is consumed by a ball of fire, its shockwave
                shattering every window in a 2-block radius. At four minutes and ten seconds, the oppressive shadow recedes,
                causing the sounds of life and civilisation to resume, with car alarms shrieking and a roaring, raging inferno
                filling the air.

                    “After the Kanto-Hoenn Great War, many families found themselves with no sons or fathers. Almost every able-bodied fighting
                    age male had been drafted into service. Women were forced to replace men in the workforce, putting a
                    lot of pressure on any older children to look after younger ones as well as take care of household duties.
                    Prized Pokemon dynasties, particularly Charizard and Dragonite lines groomed by generations upon generations
                    of trainers, were completely shattered, pulled into a nightmarish conflict with no clear moral center
                    or justification. Decades later, historians still ask, ‘Was it worth it?’ ”

                Graduation Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take my place in the midst of students assembled in the front of the podium. It is a small group, perhaps fifty-odd or
                so. Together we make up the entire school population of Pallet and Viridian. Pockets of students murmur excitedly
                to themselves as we wait for the ceremonies to start. Today, we gather in the school center in Pallet. Pallet,
                my town, is a small, modest dwelling near the edge of the Kanto region. It’s quaint, and doesn’t have many
                luxuries, but its home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last of the Trainer ceremonies finish in the late afternoon. Two rows of senior students, six in each. Ready for their
                starter pokemon. Ready for the wild. Blue and I sit behind them impatiently, along with fourteen others.
                Somewhere along the way we happen to lock eyes. I roll my eyes in boredom. Blue smirks. Seated behind us
                are the rest of the younger students. Their numbers from Viridian are considerably less than our year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason for this is the
                <span class='thought-text'>Youngster Trainer Act</span>. The Youngster Act was originally conceived as a partial answer to a trainer
                shortage problem. See, a few years ago, the Pokemon Association was facing a considerable shortage of qualified
                trainers entering its ranks. With the Trainer route seen as becoming more dangerous and less rewarding, more
                people were turning to Pokemon research and engineering as career paths, eventually forcing the Association
                to do a systemic overhaul on how it approached recruitment. Now, trainers are important for a multitude of
                reasons. One important one is that that they help cull the wild Pokemon numbers near routes and cities. With
                less trainers fighting and capturing wild Pokemon, the Pokemon populations started growing out of control.
                Attacks on human settlements became more frequent, instigated by emboldened Pokemon looking to expand their
                territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the ill-fated outcomes of the Association’s overhaul was the Youngster Trainer Act. After intensive lobbying from
                pro-Association groups, the Act was passed in Congress in record time, by a margin of 341-124.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Youngster Act was seen as a way to solve the shortage problem by essentially lowering the admission bar for trainers.
                Noting that many trainers in fact had family Pokemon since a young age, it was reasoned that the age requirement
                for obtaining a license need not be so strict. As long as they were able to display basic aptitude in commanding
                a Pokemon, as well as have the consent of a parent or guardian, anyone above the age of 10 could be awarded
                a Trainer license, well below the standard age of 17. Thousands of Youngsters, as they came to be called,
                were given their licenses through this act, letting them set out into the world. It was like sending sheep
                to the slaughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                It quickly became known as the most disastrous political act of modern times. Where the act essentially failed was determining
                where to draw the line of ‘basic aptitude’. Where one would expect stringent tests in assessing trainer knowledge
                and capability in Pokemon combat, Youngster tests were notoriously lax, with some passing after demonstrating
                one or two moves with their Pokemon. Many youngsters, after passing such tests, emerged with a false sense
                of bravado, thinking they could take on the world. Many ended up losing their lives picking fights with wild
                Pokemon hordes they had no hope of defeating. Some who managed to stay away from picking unwise fights fell
                due to basic needs - running out of rations or shelter in the wild. Professor Oak, with his foresight and
                acumen, knew nothing good could come out of the Act when it was proposed. He used all his political pull
                to exclude Pallet Town from the initial list of settlements included in the bill, saving us all in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                We watch as four of the new Trainers set off immediately towards Viridian, starter Pokemon in tow. As is tradition, many
                of the townsfolk have gathered to see them off, handing them all sorts of farewell gifts like fresh rations
                or useful Poke-items. They will be looking to obtain apprenticeships in gyms to learn and develop proficiency
                in using different Pokemon types, as well as starting a team of their own. Those with artistic inclinations
                may even head to Johto’s Goldenrod or Hoenn to participate in Contests. Me? Well, I prefer a good ole Pokemon
                showdown. Eventually I meet up with my mother who watched from the audience. She gives me a long hug, as
                if it is the last time she would ever get to hold her boy in her arms. Which is true in a way. Tomorrow I
                will not wake up a student any longer. Tomorrow, I wake up a Trainer. “Your father would be proud,” she tells
                me, eyes damp. I nod my head in acknowledgement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing you should know about me is I am my father’s son. When they came and told us he was gone, I did not cry.
                The routes in Mt Silver were notoriously treacherous, they said, even for a Sinnoh Champion. I was little
                bigger than a Bellsprout then, perhaps aged six or so. My recollection of him is hazy at best. Memories with
                him play out in my head like scenes from a holo-vid, except the parts where I should see his face are blurred
                or darkened. I have to focus to hold his visage in my mind, to see him as I remember from all those years
                back. But what I do remember was his Pokemon. His team. His family. I remember curling up beside his Luxray
                as it slept by the fire. Learning and practicing the proper gestures to convey friendliness to communicate
                with his Ursaring.
            </p>
            <p>
                These memories are why I will set off on my own journey tomorrow. Whatever my father felt towards his Pokemon, I know they were
                strong enough for him to leave home, to explore new lands and put his very life on the line. Whatever it
                is, I want to find out for myself. I need to. To do that, I must assemble my very own team. A team that I
                trust, and believe in. In striving to become the strongest trainer, I must seek out the very best. It is
                at the zenith of this mountain of contenders that I suspect I will find what I am looking for. I have been
                planning for this moment since I was a young boy. Every Pokemon fact memorized, every minute spent playing
                Catch’Em All at the playground wall, every mock battle with the other students during recess. The world wants
                a Champion? I will give it to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blue intercepts me after the festivities. Ever the showman, he cannot resist a dig at me as he passes. “Hey Red!” he calls
                I head out towards my home on the east side of Pallet. “There’s only a day left before I hafta leave you
                in the dirt. Are you ready o’pal of mine?” An ever-knowing smirk plays on his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blue is not his real name. Nor is mine Red for that matter. Blue is the nickname for none other than Gary Samuel Oak, grandson
                of the esteemed, honourable Professor in our town. Smart, quick-witted and a veritable force of nature, I
                have heard him being described as a bully by some. That would be the most utterly short-sighted and dull
                comment one could use, I think. Gary Oak knows what he wants and takes it. Always striving for excellence,
                he has topped every single one of his trainer classes since age 10. To go against Gary Oak requires bringing
                nothing less than your best. He is every bit the Pokemon genius one would expect coming from the Oak family.
                The perfect rival.
            </p>
            <p>
                That would happen, I reply good-naturedly, only to clear the way for the future Indigo champion.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Bahahaha! You’re always a hoot, Red. Don’t fall too far behind, you hear?” Blue bellows. The training he refers to is with
                his personal Pokemon, an eevee. I know he goes off into the woods near town after class, training, sparring
                with it. He wants to get it evolution-ready as soon as possible, though I have no idea what evolution line
                he plans on choosing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I, on the other hand, have no Pokemon to speak of yet. Sure, I have Pokemon at home, but those are family Pokemon. J, our
                Mistermime, helps my mother with the household chores. Polo, our Poliwhirl, has been with our family for
                as long as I can remember. Of course, he was a Poliwag back then. We took him in after saving him from a
                nasty storm near the river once. We tried taking him back afterwards, but we could never find his family
                or any Poliwhirl that would claim him. I tried training him for combat, but he seems to lack the certain
                killer instinct needed on the battlefield. Having a Pokemon whose first inclination around strangers is to
                make friends is nice to have around the house, but unfortunately is too much of a liability on the battlefield.
                Nowadays, he spends his time running errands for my mother or catching insects around our garden pond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, I will go get a proper starter Pokemon from the Professor’s Lab tomorrow. As part of his work and partially as
                a service to the community, the Professor tames certain Pokemon to give as starters to beginning Trainers.
                Nonetheless, it is not cheap. The effort and resources involved in training Pokemon are significant, especially
                when training multiple at a time, as the Professor does. I have been working part time at his Ranch for the
                past year saving zennies for this very purpose. I hoping to choose a Growlithe starter, to be honest. Growlithe
                grow into the regal Arcanine, which were known to be fiercely protective and loyal to a fault towards their
                trainers. The image of me riding into town on the back of the majestic creature, with its beige mane billowing
                in the wind does not seem like a bad prospect either.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lost in my deliberations, I do not even notice passing my street. I find myself on the edge of the field separating Pallet
                Town from the surrounding woods. The lush green grass reaches up to my hips. I am not worried about wild
                Pokemon attacking; the grass in the immediate town vicinity are often swept by the rangers for Pokemon. Looking
                to the horizon, I glimpse the setting sun, illuminating the sky with a vibrant, harsh red, partially obscured
                by the forest canopy line.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sudden commotion from behind me causes me to turn. I see a figure running towards me, waving his arms frantically and yelling
                my name. I realise it’s the Professor and some of his aides, their profile illuminated by the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just then a rustle from the front causes my head to snap back, and out from the edge of the grass I see a yellow-furred rodent
                with reddish cheeks hissing at me, teeth bared. A pikachu! On the lower end of the power scale, Pikachu are
                actually not that uncommon here. Though extremely agile, courtesy of the electricity running through their
                body, their offensive capabilities are typically limited by the amount of charge they can store in their
                cheeks, which is not the greatest. They usually roam in packs and shy away from humans, preferring to dart
                away rather than get involved in conflict. Which is exactly why the behaviour of this particular one is so
                unsettling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tails of pikachu are extremely precious to them, as they rely on them for grounding to conduct away any excess charge
                they may build up inside them. Conditioned though their bodies may be, holding too much charge for an extended
                period of time will still cause a pikachu to grow sick. Pikachu who have tails too badly damaged have to
                either get professional help at a Pokemon Centre to drain charge from their body, or die a slow death via
                electrocution. This Pikachu hunches on all fours, its body curling protectively around its flat, jagged tail.
            </p>
            <p>
                A tail which currently has a muddy boot print on it. My eyes widen in surprise.
                <span class="thought=text">Shit</span>. I immediately raise my hands to either side of my head, palms up. It is the same calming position
                I use to approach some of the fiercer Pokemon on the Professor’s Ranch, one that I learnt from befriending
                my father’s Ursaring all those years back. It is a non-threatening stance, indicating to the Pokemon that
                I mean no harm.
            </p>
            <p>
                “There there…” I murmur. Pikachu are not innately aggressive.
                <span class='thought-text'>If I just give it enough space…</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately this pikachu does not seem to get the memo. As I raise my foot to take a step back, I see it’s the fur on its
                cheeks rise –
            </p>
            <p>
                – And the next thing I know, my vision flashes white, and there is a loud ringing in my ears. As it clears, I find the world
                has upended, the ground pressed uncomfortably close to my face.
                <span class='thought-text'>I've fallen. When did I fall?</span> From the corner of my eye I see my arms spasming uncontrollably. I now
                realise the yelling has grown much closer to my position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone turning me over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shaking me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professor Oak’s concerned face appearing over me. “Can you respond, Red?” I think he yells. It is all I can do to groan in
                response. I do not have any motor control.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last thing I remember is getting lifted onto someone’s back.
            </p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <p>
                Somewhere along the dusty, cavernous paths in Victory Road, the name Yukinari Samuel Oak is etched into stone tableaus, recorded
                and acknowledged in the annals of history as the 9th winner of the Indigo League.
            </p>
            <p>
                Completing the entire Kanto Circuit at the tender young age of 19, Yukinari Oak is the youngest ever competitor to obtain
                8 gym badges as well as defeat all members of the Elite Four to obtain the title of Regional Champion. With
                such a storied past spent pokebattling, everyone expected Oak to continue his rise as one of the best Pokemon
                trainers of modern times. Unexpectedly, after subsequently going to university and obtaining a double degree
                in economics and Poke-biology, Oak withdrew from the battling circuit completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                He instead went on to attain doctorates in Pokemon physiology and psychology, and lent his considerable voice to various
                causes like the Civil Rights for Pokemon Act and the Regional City Defence Initiative. He settled down on
                a small plot of land his family owned on the outskirts of Viridian City, and around him a town gradually
                emerged and grew, as inevitable as venomoths drawn to a brilliant flame.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I next come to, I find myself lying on an examination table in the Professor’s Lab. It seems I have been carried here
                to recuperate.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ah, Red!” says Professor Oak, entering the room, “It’s a relief to see you up.” In his hands he carries a warm mug of tea
                and a cotton blanket.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What happened?” I ask, taking a sip of the tea offered to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mild electrical shock and paralysis,” he says cheerily. With his tone he could have been discussing the results of a Ponyta
                race. “There shouldn’t be anything to worry about; it'll clear up in a while.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And the Pikachu?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “A run-away from the Ranch,” says the Professor, his countenance darkening for the first time. “He was in the latest batch
                of Pokemon identified for potential starters.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ah. So that is why I do not recognize it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Unfortunately,” he continues, hand stroking his chin stubble in contemplation, “all attempts to tame the creature have been
                futile. It responds to all overtures we make towards it with unbridled hostility. In a way you were lucky
                to encounter it when you did. We’d been draining the creature’s charge just so we could interact with it
                safely. So, when it attacked you, it didn’t have much power stored.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Slowly, I assess the damage sustained. I flex my fingers, arms, shoulders, checking that nothing feels wrong or out of place.
                Nothing does. My joints feel a little sore, but it’s nothing that I will not be able to shake off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shaking my head to clear it, I thank the Professor for his assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                “How are the starter choices for tomorrow?” I ask.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Professor knows of my decision to set out. Over the past year, he has been using every argument he can think of to persuade
                me to stay. A mind like yours can accomplish great things in the proper research fields, he tells me. He
                knows my test scores are the only ones to ever rival Gary’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Months ago, when I was just starting the Ranch job, I had the privilege of accompanying the Professor and his aides to the
                Indigo Plateau for a research seminar. I saw how his aides scrambled for passes and the appropriate papers
                at each checkpoint, while the Professor impatiently waved away the guards away from the both of us, striding
                through like a man who’s right to be there had long been secured with deeds and accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way he effortlessly got people to listen to him, through earnestness and determination, reminded me starkly of my father.
                It was the air of a Champion, an aura was only obtained from adventure and hardship.
            </p>
            <p>
                “They’re coming along nicely. I’ll have three requisitioned and ready for you tomorrow,” the Professor sighs, “Are you sure
                you won’t change your mind son?”
            </p>
            <p>
                No, I tell him. It’s what I need to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Professor’s lips purse into a fine line. He is not used to accepting no for an answer. His entire career has been built
                on breaking accepted norms and setting exceptional precedents. Very few have stood in the path of this man
                and not capitulated eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Very well then,” he says, nodding to himself in resignation. Ever the consummate scientist, he accepts this new data and
                changes his tack, “I suppose I shouldn’t be so hasty in disabusing you of your notions, after I myself took
                the path in my youth. In that case, could I interest you in assisting me in a field study?”
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest is piqued. “What do you mean?” I query.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m talking about the new Kanto Pokedex v.2. The Association has been hounding me for months, ever since Elm and his team
                in Johto released their Johto dex last year. They think we need a spangling new Pokedex so ‘we don’t fall
                behind’, they say. Ha!” He snorts in derision, “So they don’t lose face when they gather for the Indigoan
                Council, more like.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, in any case, I decided to get on with it to stop their incessant nagging. So, I have several brand new v.2 prototypes,
                complete with all the fancy new features like region-wide pokeball transfer coverage and pokemon location
                tracking that all the Johto-ians are going to be jealous of. The thing is, they’re fresh off the factory
                line and need to be tested. How about it? You’ll be able to make use of its features during your travels
                and get a stipend as my research assistant at the same time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                My eyes widen in amazement. The pokedex is a coveted Pokemon encyclopedia on the move. No, more than that, it’s an invaluable
                tool for any adventurers looking to travel to foreign and unknown lands. With state of the art location mapping
                and pokemon tracking tools, many a lost adventurer has been saved by relying on the pokedex to navigate around
                pokemon territories and nests to get to safety. But of course, such valuable things are priced accordingly.
                Pokedexes are strictly regulated, with the Association only permitting sales to recognized individuals based
                on a variety of criteria, in addition to having a hefty price tag on top of that. Suffice to say they are
                not instruments wielded by the common trainer.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the Professor to offer one to a newly graduated trainer would be unheard of. After saving for a year I barely have enough
                to pay for a starter Pokemon and basic kit. I would never be able to afford this. So, it is a shame I am
                going to have to decline his generosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’d hafta be an idiot not to take the deal, Red.” drawls Blue, strolling into the room looking like he’s just stepped
                off a runway as usual. Tucked under one of his arms is a brown parcel, which he promptly drops on a desk.
                “The package dude said this was amber level, or whatever,” he says, as he props himself up against the table.
                His Eevee, evidently taking time out of his ball, pads around the corner, settling itself in a space under
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey Red, heard you had a nice heart-to-heart with the feral rodent Gramps picked up. Now that you’re a real trainer you
                can seal the deal by picking it as your starter,” Blue guffaws, having heard of the incident from one of
                the aides and finding the entire story to be thoroughly entertaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                “NO,” Professor Oak interjects with an air of authority, “One thing you’ll come to learn when you’ve been doing this for
                as long as I have, boys, is that some Pokemon are just not suited as partners. You’ll need to focus your
                efforts on ventures that will bear fruit.” He signals one of his aides with a nod, and gestures for the parcel
                to be taken into one of the back rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t intend to, Professor,” I say.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turning his attention back on Blue, Professor Oak asks, “I assume you’ll be setting off now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yep,” Blue replies, fiddling with a stray wire he finds on the desk, “gonna pick up some last minute stuff before heading
                out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                My ears perk up at this. “You’re leaving?” I ask.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yea Reddo'. Starting my journey this evening. Gonna make camp tonight at a rest house and get ta Viridian tomorrow. And
                I am ever so eager to make use of this,” he says as he pulls out a red oblong device from his pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
                A pokedex!
            </p>
            <p>
                The Professor extended the invitation to him too, I realise, before laughing at my own stupidity. Of course he would. The
                star pupil of Pallet Town, already with his own starter, and to top it all off the grandson of one of the
                most famous individuals in the world! Why shouldn’t he have a Pokedex to start off as well? It was hard to
                not feel like one was being left in the dirt around Blue.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll do it Professor,” I say looking at him with an intensity alive in my eyes, “And I’ll take the Pikachu too.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It is almost worth it to see Blue’s eyes almost bulge out of their sockets alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What?” the Professor exclaims, incredulous, “In Arceus’s name, have you not listened to a single word I’ve said?” I see
                a weariness in him, a worry that I am making a costly, impulsive mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps it is rashness. Perhaps it is a desire to prove my worthiness, somehow. Perhaps it is to convince myself that I am
                worthy of this burden. It is certainly not rational, and I do not try to convince them otherwise. But I know
                that if I succeed at getting the Pikachu on my side, I will have done something not even Blue or Professor
                Oak considered possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That Pikachu, if nothing else, is a survivor. I’ve seen its eyes. I’ll make it work.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And that is that. The Professor eventually has to give in to my stubborness. Blue breaks out in another round of laughter,
                mostly in disbelief. But as we leave the facility, Blue turns to me, eyes serious for the first time this
                day.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey Red. Don’t fall too far behind, ya hear? We have a score to settle. And we are going to do it on a stage befitting our
                glory.” I feel his eyes bore into mine, seeking that one inscrutable truth, a reassurance that I will not
                let him down. And just like that, the moment passes. He breaks into a smirk, and turns away, waving an arm
                in the air, walking into the night. “Well, smell ya later!”
            </p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>
                I find my mother seated at the kitchen table when I get home. Her eyes are red, cheeks puffy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I go to take a seat directly across from her. For the longest time, we say nothing. But still, I wait. I sense it is important
                we have this moment. I take the chance to acknowledge her, the brave woman who bravely raised a child by
                herself after her husband’s untimely demise. She deserves a better son.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t want to lose you,” she finally says, lips quivering as she speaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                You won’t, I tell her. I will always be careful, and I will write back often.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where will you go?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever my journey takes me. First Viridian, then Pewter. After that, who knows?
            </p>
            <p>
                “Can you at least take a friend with you to Viridian? I don’t want you travelling alone.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I will have to be alone eventually, I reply. Besides, the woods of Viridian are not particularly dangerous compared to other
                sites in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                We fall back into silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her final reply is a brisk nod, a resignation that her son is determined to follow in the steps of her husband. Without another
                word she gets up and heads to her bedroom. I sense she will not be coming back out for the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remain sitting for some time more. Polo saddles up to me, takes my hand and pats it, as if to reassure me. He can sense
                the conflict, the tension, even if he cannot fully comprehend the reason. Pwoo, he chirps, as he launches
                a pellet of water from his spiralled center into my face. I know what you’re thinking. A domesticated Pokemon
                attacking its trainer? Blasphemy. Well, not exactly. Polo is pushing me to play a game we’ve had between
                us for years. Grabbing a bag of acorns, we walk to the door facing the back garden. I take an acorn and throw
                it up in the air. After a moment’s concentration, Polo lets loose with a jet of water, knocking the acorn
                out of the air. <span class='thought-text'>Pwoo!</span>, he exclaims, raising his hands in triumph. Taking two from the bag this time, I throw
                them up simultaneously. Two jets of water soon follow to shoot down the targets. And it proceeds on like
                that, me throwing up more and more acorns and challenging Polo to hit them all before they touch the ground.
                We’d started this game ages ago, when I noticed Polo had exceptional water expulsion control, occasionally
                hitting fruits and nuts out of trees around Pallet. Gradually, I’d challenged him with more and more targets
                till his accuracy and speed improved to be superhumanly (superpoliwhirly?) good. As the bag grows empty and
                the last of the acorns fall to the ground, he alternates raising his fists in the air, one after the other.
                Job well done, he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot help but chuckle. This moment of abject familiarity does wonders for raising my spirits. I lift the Poliwhirl to
                my lap and hold it. Polo’s smooth, translucent blue back is cool to the touch. Polo reaches into my vest,
                pulls out an empty Pokeball and holds it out in his hand, nudging me. Pwooo. He looks up at me with those bright bulbous eyes characteristic of his species.
                I sit there for some time more. Polo saddles up to me and takes my hand and pats it, as if to reassure me. He can sense some
                conflict, some tension, even if he cannot fully comprehend the reason. I lift the Poliwhirl to my lap and
                hold it. Polo’s smooth, blue back is cool to the touch. Polo reaches into my vest, pulls out an empty Pokeball
                and holds it out in his hand, nudging me. Pwooo, he says, looking up at me with bright eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You...want to come with me?” I ask in surprise. Pwooo! He raises his hands up, as if in victory. I admit I never considered
                this. Polo has been a fixture in my house for so long that to take him away would seem...wrong. But at the
                same time, I cannot deny that having a trustworthy pokemon at my side would be a great help, and water pokemon
                at that. In a pinch, he could help me in sourcing out freshwater sources, or provide some of his own, even
                if his battling prowess was not top notch. I cannot help but feel a weight of my shoulders as I think about
                it. Going into pokemon territory armed only with a potentially hostile Pikachu is not the most reassuring
                feeling.

                So there, at my kitchen table, I add the first Pokemon to my championship team.

                Come morning, I bid a final farewell to my mother and collect my items from Professor Oak. It is a solemn, quiet affair, with none of the fanfare
                of the day before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gazing at the path out of Pallet, with towering oak trees framing verdant fields extending out to the horizon, I feel a new
                energy fill me. Looking behind, I see the familiar, brick edifices of the only town I have ever known, with
                all my past regrets, failures and accomplishments. In front of me, I see eternity.

                    “After the Treaty of Sootopolis and the dissolution of the united Kanto-Johto war effort, leaders from both Kanto and Johto
                    saw a need for a formal peacetime alliance to be established in order to hasten recovery as well as defend
                    themselves from further foreign aggression…

                <p>
                    ...And so after terse negotiations, both sides signed a series of long term trade and military pacts, with leaders convening
                    biennially at the Indigo Plateau to discuss regional matters and affairs concerning the continuation
                    of the newly christened Indigo Alliance.”
