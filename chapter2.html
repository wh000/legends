                    “At the first summit of the Indigo Council, it became clear that a representative needed to be chosen. An ambassador; a leader
                    that could direct the council as well as lead the defence of its walls if ever necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This led to the forming of the original Elite Four, made up of four of the strongest trainers at the time, and the Indigo
                    League, consisting of all the existing gym leaders in Kanto and Johto. Trainers were given the opportunity
                    to challenge Pokemon gyms all around the region to collect badges and work their way up to eventually
                    fighting the Elite Four.

                <p>
                    While fighting and defeating at least two members consecutively was enough to earn to the title of regional champion, the
                    title of Grand Champion was reserved for the individual who defeated all members of the group in addition
                    to the currently serving Grand Champion, if any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was this Champion that was chosen to lead the Indigo Council; to act as a bulwark against any storms that would crash
                    against the shores of the Indigo Alliance. ”

                Do you know how Blue and I got our nicknames?
            </p>
            <p>
                It was on a fateful summer afternoon, many years back. I’d been playing Catch’Em All by myself on the dusty asphalt surrounding
                the town playground. Catch’Em All is a game children play with coloured stones, each representing specific
                Pokemon.
            </p>
            <p>
                You would catch pokemon by designating ‘catch-zones’ a certain distance away, with the exact length and radius of the zone
                determined by the Pokemon and how difficult it was to catch. You would then use a soft rubber ball and take
                turns throwing, seeing whose ball was the first to enter the zone, thus claiming ownership of that Pokemon.
                As a matter of pride, I almost never missed. You could then battle other children and their team of Pokemon
                stones, with battles typically settled by Pokemon typing, argument, and a whole lot of imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there I was, catching all of the native Kanto Pokemon species, when none other than Gary Oak comes up to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You missed Grimer and Muk there, Red,” Gary says, as he sprawls on the ground beside me, “Grimer comes after Dewgong. You
                jumped straight to Shellder.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It was true, at least according to the official Kanto numbering used in the Pokedex. Knowing Blue, he probably memorized
                the entire list of Kanto-Johto native Pokemon by the age of nine.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why did you call me Red?” I ask.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Cuz of yer hat and vest of course. It’s the most striking about ya, so it only makes sense, don’t it?” he replies with a
                casual air of nonchalance.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was referring to my outfit, a red and white hat and a maroon vest over a simple black undershirt. The hat was special,
                left behind by my father when he left. The vest had been a birthday present from my mother that year. It
                is a clothing preference that I maintain till this day, with a bigger vest of course. I cannot really explain
                why I keep it. Perhaps the simple, pragmatic nature of the outfit appeals to be. A hat to keep the sun out
                of my eyes, always important when catching Pokemon, and a vest to keep me warm at night when it gets chilly.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay,” I tell him, “then you’re Blue.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Blue, huh? Cuz of my eyes I take it?” he chuckles, amused by my reply.
            </p>
            <p>
                I nod. Gary had a set of piercing blue eyes, eyes that seemed to make girls swoon without fail, as I noted with irritation
                and no small bit of envy while growing up.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so it was on that day that I formally started my friendship and everlasting rivalry with Blue. He sat beside me, and
                competed with me as we worked our way through the entire known list of Pokemon, even encompassing Hoenn’s,
                and including the fearsome and overpowered Dragon types to boot. We fought, we played, we argued, refusing
                to give each other any quarter in our imaginary pokebattles. Somewhere along the way, my mother arrived to
                bring me home, and ended up watching us from the sidelines. She did not come over to say anything, rather,
                she called Professor Oak and they watched as we fought for bragging rights and the glory of playground domination.
                Eventually it ended in a Dragonite versus Salamence stalemate, as both species were recorded as being virtually
                unsurpassed in their endurance as well as destructive capability.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the greatest day of my life. I think it was also the day we both decided, that somewhere down the line, we would meet
                once again to settle the question hanging over our heads. A real battle, fought with real stakes and an unspoken
                agreement to give nothing less than our very best.

            <div class="separator">


            </div>

            <p>
                A day after leaving Pallet Town, I find myself in the wooded quarters separating Pallet and Viridian City. Rattatas, pidgeys,
                and even the odd bug Pokemon or two roam freely here. I pay them little heed; the Pokemon around Pallet are
                mostly non-aggressive, which leaves me with an opportunity to concentrate on dealing with the newest addition
                to my team. I am sitting on an upturned rock in a small clearing with a freshwater spring, which Polo helpfully
                led me to. Polo is back in its ball, as I sit chewing some dried Tauros jerky. My lunch companion sits a
                few feet away, eyeing me with no small measure of disgust and hostility. It is a stare I return in kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though, I think I have found the one thing which Pikachu hates more than me. I noticed it the first time I released Pikachu
                from his pokeball. As the red capture light receded, letting Pikachu materialise in front of me, Pikachu
                immediately lashed out with a strike of electricity - not at me - but at the ball, growling in anger. I noted
                the attack with surprise. It is rare that a pokemon should regard pokeball capture with this much vitriol.
                It is an entirely painless process, with the pokemon suspended and kept in a unique stasis field while inside.
                The pokemon should experience no passage of time between entering and emerging from the ball. Yet, something
                about the process had clearly riled Pikachu up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu then shifted its attention to me. He clearly remembered me from the day before. I raised up the cord I brought along.
                It was made of combination of rubber and metal, specially designed to train electric pokemon. By swinging
                the cord in the air, like a miniature windmill, the cord would attract any electric attacks aimed at me and
                negate it by virtue of its high insulating properties. For good measure, I am also wearing insulative black
                rubber gloves, the type repairmen may use in handling high voltage cables.
            </p>
            <p>
                It nearly wasn't enough. Snarling and hissing a terrible war-cry, the Pikachu instead chose to charge at me, claws and teeth
                bared. Digging its claws into my vest, I see his fur raise as he charged the mother of all electric shocks.
                Clamping by hands around his cheeks, I thought to prevent the attack before the charge could build up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Ah, the ignorance of youth.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pikachu’s cheeks lighting up, I felt rather than saw the lightning unleashed from the ferocious rodent, a torrent of
                electricity pitted against industrial-strength insulation. The gloves fizzled and popped as they heated up,
                pain lancing up my arms as they melted against my skin. I suffered a bloody gash across my chin, and my vest
                was ripped to shreds by the time the Pikachu stopped its attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Who knew those little creatures could carry that much voltage (or anger for that matter)? By the time it was over, I held
                a whole new respect for rodents. Flipping the Pikachu on its stomach, I tackled him to the ground and held
                him. I felt his heart thudding like a jackhammer as he struggled in vain against me. The poor thing was terrified,
                I realised, as he whimpered on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the intervening time, Pikachu and I managed to come to a sort of tentative stalemate. After thwarting several attempts
                at running away - courtesy of the pokeball’s helpful function of triggering a return light every time its
                registered pokemon gets too far - and furthering Pikachu’s frustration each time, I managed to get him to
                at least follow me by getting the cord tied to a collar I’d affixed around his neck,acting like a leash.
                It was clear that Pikachu would at least tolerate being directed around rather than have to be subjected
                to pokeball transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, it was a far cry from having a Pokemon that would actually listen to me in battle. It also did not help
                that Pikachu seemed equally hostile towards Polo, shocking it if it got too close. An act which, as a water
                Pokemon, Polo did not appreciate at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, having the first chance to properly observe the creature, I realise it is quite possibly the biggest and meanest of
                its species I have ever seen. Not that this Pikachu was human-sized or anything - Pikachu normally grow to
                around forty centimetres as a full adult - but this Pikachu was positively a giant, towering at well over
                half a metre.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Look, you and I are going to have to come to some understanding soon,” I murmur, pushing a handful of poketreats in its
                direction as a peace offering of sorts. Poketreats are a tasty, efficient way of feeding Pokemon on the move.
                Nutritious and high in calories, they have proven to be passable replacements for Pokemon food in places
                that may be a far cry from a Pokemon’s natural habitat.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cram a piece into my mouth, saying “Ith good, thee?”. I cringe inside. It may be good for pokemon, but it sure as hell
                tastes bland and unappetizing to humans.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Arceus damn you, Pikachu. Give me something. Anything.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, Pikachu gives in to the growls emanating from his stomach. Sniffing suspiciously at the treats, he gathers them
                in his paws and scampers away, far as the leash lets him, snapping his head back several times as if to make
                sure I do not follow. He then proceeds to zap each piece, frying them to a shade of charcoal black before
                shoving the food into his mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sigh. It’s not much, but at least I’d gotten him to start accepting food from me.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two generally accepted strategies for training Pokemon. One is to build up a bond of trust and loyalty with your
                partner Pokemon. With this bond, Pokemon have at times been observed to surpass their physical limits to
                obey their trainer. Trainers who have developed incredibly strong bonds with their Pokemon have been also
                known to demonstrate a fascinating ability called the
                <span class="thought-text">trainer sense</span>, a phenomena in which Pokemon and trainer share a wordless, almost supernatural, instantaneous
                communication of understanding and intent. This, however, can take years, or even decades to fully develop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second way is through aggression and domination. Whipping Pokemon into submission, though unpopular and regarded as immoral
                by the vast majority of trainers, has been acknowledged to get results, at least in getting Pokemon to obey
                orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, training methods also differ from species to species. Ursaring, which are known to respect strength, will follow
                a strong, courageous trainer who has proven himself to the ends of the earth. The majority of grass Pokemon
                you can train just by feeding lots of high-grade fertilizer and watering at the correct times. Dragon Pokemon,
                who are so rare they live almost solely in legend and in campfire tales, can take decades to breed and fully
                mature. The resulting Pokemon, though, is a virtually invulnerable engine of destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not want so train Pikachu through violence. I have seen scores of poor, beaten Pokemon abused by their trainers in the
                news. The image of scarred, gaunt Pokemon with horror-filled eyes is something that does not leave you easily.
                I am determined to get through to Pikachu; to win him over to my side. What I do not know yet, is how.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am in the midst of gathering up my supplies after lunch when a Zigzagoon peeks its head into our clearing. Pikachu, hitherto
                content to simmer and brood in silence, reacts to this intrusion immediately, hissing and directing a jolt
                of electricity at the Zigzagoon’s head. Yelping in shock, the poor creature scampers off.
            </p>
            <p>
                I frown at this display. Almost all contemporary literature on Pikachu are in agreement that Pikachu are not at all territorial
                creatures. Scavenging where they can, they are usually content to live in harmony with other docile woodland
                Pokemon. Somehow, I have in my hands a specimen that defies all conventional understanding.
            </p>


            <div class="separator">

            </div>


            <p>
                Have you ever wondered how Pikachu manage to act as walking miniature electricity munitions? It is a curious thing. They
                start by gathering charge inside their cheek pouches. Positive charge goes inwards, negative charge goes
                outwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                After building up a significant charge difference, the environment around it naturally seeks a way to neutralise. A buildup
                of positive charge happens on surfaces around the Pikachu. The resulting electric field is strong enough
                to ionize the surrounding air, making it more conductive. This soup of positive ions and free electrons,
                or
                <span class='thought-text'>plasma</span>, is all the Pikachu needs to channel the charge along a pathway of its choosing. This all happens
                in the space of microseconds. The exact strength and range of the shock, of course, is dependant on the individual
                Pikachu. From a high enough vantage point, Pikachu have been recorded to be able to channel electric bolts
                from as far as a kilometre away.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is around late afternoon when Pikachu tenses, muscles taut as it crouches on all fours. Its ears twitch rapidly. I feel
                the hair on the back of my neck tingling, a tell-tale sign of static accumulating in the air. Noticing this,
                I pull myself away from clearing the thickets and bramble blocking our path and scan the surroundings.
                <span class='thought-text'>Something Pikachu considers to be a threat? Or, knowing this Pikachu, it could be as trivial as not liking
                    the colour of the sky</span>, I think to myself dryly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a few moments though, the apparent reason for Pikachu’s apprehension becomes clear. In the distance, across a stream,
                are a horde of wild pikachu. There are about 4 or 5 in the group, frolicking in the shallow water. I pause
                with bated breath, hand reaching for my pokeball. Pikachu were intensely communal creatures, instinctively
                forming social groups that banded together for protection. If this were any other Pikachu, I would expect
                it to immediately call to its species, wanting to unite with them against the evil human tyrant trying to
                subjugate one of their own. Instead, Pikachu just tracks them with distrusting eyes, attention never leaving
                them for an instant until they pass out of sight, upon which he resumes staring sullenly at the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                I view this exchange with great curiosity. Just what had transpired in Pikachu’s past to make it so untrusting towards his
                own kind?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Nature is not kind to outliers.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to ensure the survival of a species, it strives to pass on favourable traits to offspring while culling those with
                traits deemed useless to the tribe. For Pikachu, chances of survival improve exponentially when gathered
                in groups, relying on each other for food and protection. Centuries of reproduction would have ingrained
                these survival instincts into every one of its kind, killing off anomalies hopefully before they reproduced
                and polluted the gene pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever the reason, it was clear that this pikachu had decided to live as a loner, defying the odds in a world that told
                him he could not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend the rest of the time in the fading daylight finding a spot to make camp for the night. Pikachu seems to get perverse
                pleasure from zapping Polo anytime it’s out of its ball. I sigh in exasperation. I need Polo to track good
                watering holes to camp at, but until Pikachu learns to play nice with others I will have to keep Polo’s active
                time out the ball at a minimum. Eventually Polo gets angered enough that he sends a bubble attack Pikachu’s
                way. The spray of projectiles all hit Pikachu at point blank range, leaving the rodent’s fur heavy with moisture.
                For an instant Pikachu has a look of surprise on its face, clearly not expecting such retaliation. Shaking
                off the water, Pikachu smartly refrains any further acts of provocation for the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dinner is thankfully uneventful, with Polo helpfully catching us fish from a small stream that we find. We have found a cozy
                spot on the banks of the flowing water, with one side sheltered by a natural ridge to give us some cover.
                I get the fish simmering over a cackling fire, and soon I have an array of fragrant skewered delicacies to
                sample from. Pikachu, as usual, chooses to fry his dinner itself, taking the raw fish away to a corner to
                zap.

            <p>
                I spend some time planning my route and orienting myself on my map by starlight ( standard skills picked up in trainer studies).
                Viridian is near, and I will arrive early the next morning. Usually folks hiking between Pallet and Viridian
                would stop at one of the halfway rest-houses to spend the night, but with Pikachu’s strong aversion to humans
                i judged it wiser to camp in the wilderness instead. There I will stock up on supplies and prepare for the
                next leg of my journey into Viridian woods. Before long, the last light fades out and let myself fall into
                deep slumber beside the dying embers of my camp fire.

            <p>
                I wake up to a nightmare. Gunfire assaults my ears.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>No</span>, I realise,
                <span class='thought-text'>electricity</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growls and hisses fill the air. We are under attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                The air pops and cracks loudly as it is superheated repeatedly by electric bolts. I scramble backwards, fumbling blindly
                for my flint and steel. My only sources of illumination in the pitch blackness of night are the momentary
                flashes of electricity as they are thrown. I sense Pikachu in front of me, snarling as he launches attack
                after attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Dammit! Who are we fighting?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                I finally get my flint and steel in hand. Striking them hard against one another, I watch desperately as sparks disappear
                to nothingness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Come on come on come on.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Two hits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally i see with blessed relief as the tinder catches, igniting into wonderous flame with a big
                <span class='thought-text'>whoosh</span>-
            </p>
            <p>
                -And I am greeted by the sight of five pikachu circling, surrounding us, angry eyes glinting in the firelight. They could
                well be the same ones we encountered earlier. The air is wroth with lightning, arcs of electricity curling
                through the air faster than my eyes can trace, the afterimages of which dance in my vision. After a moment
                I realise to my horrific fascination this is no random attack.
                <span class='thought-text'>They are all targeting Pikachu</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am dumbfounded at the fight unfolding before me. If these pikachu were attacking to chase out intruders, they would no
                doubt first attack the strange human creature that was not one of their own. They were be known to be wary
                of other pikachu outside their communal group, but never openly hostile. Yet these pikachu had clearly decided
                that mine was the enemy,
            </p>
            <p>
                I see Pikachu meet several lightning strikes midway in the air, diverting them with strikes of his own. Others it pulls into
                itself, absorbing, diverting them back to the opposing pikachu. The hypersensitive whiskers of Pikachu, specially
                attuned to static in the air, let him intuit the direction of incoming strikes with almost supernatural accuracy.
                Battles between electric Pokemon are not bouts of strength. They are battles of skill, of reflex. In the
                space of seconds, dozens of lightning strikes are meted out, traded, and blocked. Pikachu is sorely outnumbered,
                but, with the ferocious tenacity I have come to recognize, throws himself into the fight, parrying, riposting,
                giving back as much as he receives. But for all his valiant efforts, it is simply not enough. Every so often
                a stray arc hisses against his fur, causing Pikachu to yelp in pain and frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>Nature is not kind to outliers.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier, Pikachu warily let the group of pikachu pass without so much as a cry or greeting, knowing immediately to be on
                his guard, For his reaction to be so instant, so absolute, this must not have been a one time occurence.
                That defensive behavior was borne out of repeated hostile encounters, defying every natural survival instinct
                in his being. What must it have been like, getting shunned by your own kin, I wondered. To live everyday
                with nothing and no one to depend on, pitted against a world which neither cared for or bothered with your
                fate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had pegged Pikachu for a loner, a hermit who shunned contact with his own kind. But i was wrong. More than that, I see
                now that he was a fighter. That this Pikachu had managed to survive this long in the wild was a testament
                to his tenacity. Never truly having a place to belong, he was an outsider; a rebel. A relic from a time long
                past that should never have existed today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that, I think to myself, I can understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In that moment, I see my path laid out for me. It is not a matter of choosing one decision over another, it is now simply
                a matter of execution. The surety of it fills every fibre of my being, like a raw flame ignited and spreading
                from the depths of my soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quick as I can manage, I dart forward, keeping low to the ground, leg extended as I build momentum for a kick at the nearest
                pikachu. My foot connects with a satisfying thud, sending the pikachu hurtling back into the trunk of a tree
                with a pained squeal. Pikachu reflexes are fast, but not that fast. In the same motion, I snatch up my spare
                training cord from my upturned backpack and start swinging it in my left hand, keeping the perpendicular
                face of the cord aimed at the remaining pikachu. Almost immediately my makeshift charge diverter intercepts
                several strikes aimed at me, the wild pikachu reacting unkindly to this new opponent in their midst.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seizing the temporary opening in their attacks, Pikachu lets loose a particularly fierce thunderbolt, catching a pikachu
                squarely in the cheek. The scent of burning fur fills the air as the pikachu cries out and scrambles away.
                Pikachu rely on their cheek pouches to unleash their electric attacks; disable those and you effectively
                neuter their combat ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving up beside Pikachu, our gazes meet for a split instant. I feel Pikachu acknowledging me for the first time, if not
                as a friend then as a temporary partner in this desperate battle. Pikachu now goes on the offensive, letting
                loose a terrible fury of lightning strikes at the remaining three pikachu. For my part, I keep angled myself
                at the enemies around Pikachu’s flank. As a mere human I have no hope of catching the creatures; I would
                just get in the way. The best thing I can do is to guard Pikachu’s flank, so that he can focus on obliterating
                the opposing ones with superior firepower.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a brief, exhilarating moment, Pikachu and I are totally in sync. Pikachu snatches lightning aimed at my flank, and sends
                it back with twice the force. I keep my attention focused on maintaining my shield; if I get shocked and
                paralysed it’s all over. Lashing out with my foot at any foes who get too close, I move in tandem with my
                partner to let it get in the best forward position possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our formation works. The opposing pikachu get peppered with a multitude of electric burns, searing one badly in the leg causing
                it to limp. Pikachu gets hold of a stray tail in the melee and tears at it, and is rewarded with a pained
                cry. Somewhere along the way I snatch up a fairly large piece of firewood. With my makeshift baton, I swing
                at our foes, causing them to scatter once again in search of other openings. But Pikachu is there to meet
                them, forking and twisting lightning to meet their attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                After what seems like an eternity, the last of the pikachu flee, judging the life of my Pikachu to not be worth the apparent
                cost. My arm is exhausted from the relentless swinging. I suffer various cuts and bruises from stray bolts.
                Pikachu’s fur is covered with its own splotchy burns and lacerations, and it gasps in pain and fatigue. Thankfully
                none are too bad, as far as I can tell. Pokemon Centre facilities will be able to fix him right up. As the
                cord falls to my side, I give him a tired smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we can do anything else, my vision flashes with a blinding white. A nasty thundershock sears Pikachu’s sides as Pikachu
                snarls in anger. My mind races through the possibilities, cataloging and eliminating each one as I arrive
                at the only conclusion. The first pikachu, the one I thought I had kicked into submission, was back with
                a vengeance. With a terrible cry, Pikachu hurls himself at his foe, biting, scratching as the enemy lets
                loose with a series of shocks. With dawning horror, I realise Pikachu must be low on charge. He had given
                everything he had in the previous battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their frantic melee leads them over the bank and into the stream. I lunge forward, knowing already that I am too late. My
                stomach leaps to my throat as I cry out in defiance and helplessness.
            </p>
            <p>
                “PIKACHUUU!”
            </p>
            <p>
                As if in response, a final thundershock illuminates the night, followed by a deathly silence. Scrambling to the edge, afraid
                of what I might find, an immense relief grips my heart as I see my Pikachu floating along, shrugging fresh
                pikachu brain matter off himself. Blood pools at my ankles as I wade over, gathering him in my arms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing it over to the fire, I cannot help but be comforted when he shakes itself indignantly from my grasp and crawls over
                to the opposite side of the flames to lie down. That he has the energy to show attitude means he will be
                alright. Licking its wounds and fur, he keeps one distrusting eye on me, hissing at any attempts to approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frustration wells up inside me. Did Pikachu not feel the same way I did on the battlefield? Could it be that I merely imagined
                the connection we had? No. I refuse to believe that. I run my fingers through my matted hair, exasperated.
                Finally, I come to a decision. An all or nothing play. If that, and the battle together, are not enough to
                convince him, then I would accept that nothing I did would be enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resting a few feet away, on a rock, is Pikachu’s pokeball. As I go to take it, Pikachu hisses at me, scampering back, eyeing
                the device with undisguised hatred and animosity. Thumbing it open, I take a piece of rock and bring it down
                on the joint, smashing it once, twice, shattering it. I hold the two halves of the ball up to Pikachu, then
                drop them into the smouldering fire. Reaching forward, I unhook the collar from Pikachu’s neck as well, effectively
                freeing it. The smell of burnt plastic and metal soon fills the air. For a long, precious moment neither
                of us make a move, with only the sound of the cackling fire filling the void as I hold Pikachu’s now contemplative
                gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my hail mary. Do or die.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Either run or join me, you damn rat,” I whisper, my nerves taut with suspense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, after an unbearable silence, Pikachu trudges over to my bag and digs out my bag of poketreats. I let out a breath
                I didn't even realise I was holding, along with an unbidden sob. I promise myself that, from now on, Pikachu
                will never have to fight alone. A wave of wondrous emotion overwhelms me as I cry, and laugh, probably looking
                like a maniac. Pouring out a generous handful of treats, I set them in front of Pikachu.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class='thought-text'>You earned it, partner.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking a piece, Pikachu cannot seem to fry it as he usually does, however, nose wrinkling in frustration. Its cheeks spark
                and stutter, but they do not coalesce into the familiar thundershock I have grown accustomed to seeing. I
                realise that Pikachu did indeed give his all earlier in the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a moment's contemplation, I grab a stick and skewer the treat on it, holding it over the fire. When I think it reaches
                the familiar shade of charcoal black that Pikachu prefers, I reach out and offer it. Hesitantly, Pikachu
                leans over and gives the charred treat a sniff. He scrunches up his nose once again, as if unimpressed at
                my efforts, but accepts it. He then raises his head to look expectantly at me, as if saying,
                <span class='thought-text'>what, is that it</span>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Chuckling, I repeat the process until all the treats are gone. Stomach sated, Pikachu curls up into a ball to sleep, and
                I allow myself to do the same.
            </p>
