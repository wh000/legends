                    “The first Pokemon Gyms in Kanto were set up shortly after the unification of Kanto in late Edo period. Proposed by General
                    Enomoto, the Shogunate’s chief military strategist, they were conceived as way of advancing the trainer
                    level of the common folk, to defend the land at a time when strife and conflict were commonplace in the
                    region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first iteration of Gyms were not categorized by type, but rather were assigned instructors from Enomoto’s famed warrior
                    coterie. These instructors were charged with raising the Pokemon battling proficiency of the citizens,
                    many of whom were poor and had little to no existing battling knowledge.”

            <p>
                [Mallory]
            </p>
            <p>
                Mallory crashed through the prickly undergrowth, forearms sporting various cuts and bruises beating away offending vegetation
                during her reckless sprint. Her thin limbs were slick with perspiration. Mallory didn’t know where she was
                going. Hadn’t known for a while now. The dim moon, obscured further by the forest’s thick canopy layer, offered
                little in the way of illumination, and it seemed like branches and thickets assaulted her from every direction,
                disorienting her. She tried to fight back rising panic with quick, fevered breaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                She had known, somehow, when they came to tell her of Luke’s death. That nothing was going to be the same ever again. They
                had tried to soften the blow by using big, adult words. It’s an ongoing missing persons investigation, they
                said. Your brother just disappeared, they said when she pressed them. Yeah, right. Mallory knew better, didn’t
                she? At age seven, her teachers were always saying she was one of the cleverest students in her class. A
                future Grand Champion, she overheard Mr Parsons saying once. She liked Mr Parsons. So yes, she knew. Luke
                would never have gone anywhere far without telling her, or taking her with him.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she came back from school and saw Napa, her brother’s black and grey mightyena, on the front lawn, having tore its way
                through their wooden fence, her first thought was one of joy. Could she have been mistaken? Luke was back,
                and he’d tell her all about where he’d been, and she’d scold him for just leaving without saying anything
                -
            </p>
            <p>
                But then Napa turned to her, and she saw its face, contorted into a mask of hatred and anger that was dreadfully out of place
                on the usually friendly Pokemon. Its eyes seemed alien. Its irises, constricted to single points, lent it
                a visage of otherworldly terror, and it was only thanks to lifelong familiarity that she was able to recognize
                the beast at all. But, by far, the worst shock of all was the blood dripping from the mightyena’s fangs,
                flecks of brown fur fresh on its muzzle. And on laying in front of it on the grass, what was left of Rowl,
                their pet zigzagoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                A deep, primal instinct surged up in her, one sharpened to perfection by prey over millenia, one that spoke of how to survive
                in the face of overwhelming danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Run.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                If Mallory had reacted instantly, she might have been able to dash around the house to the shed in their back garden, where
                she could have locked herself in and called for help. Or, she might have hurried past Napa, to her neighbours,
                where old man Jones stayed. He had an high-powered airgun, specifically for defending himself against wild
                Pokemon. He would have kept her safe. But as it was, her mind simply spent too long trying to reconcile the
                rabid canine in front of her with dear Napa the mightyena from her memories, so she did neither of those
                things. After a fraction of a second, her window of opportunity passed, and the mightyena started advancing
                toward her.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so Mallory did the only thing she could think of, what she loved to do whenever Luke and her played Catch the Swellow
                and she got named the Swellow. She turned left, running perpendicular to the pathway, past the neighbourhood
                perimeter, and dove into the forested quarters behind their house. She knew the vines and bramble would be
                hindrances, but she was littler than Luke, so they tended to hinder Luke more than her. Luke never managed
                to catch her once she hid deep enough. She somehow doubted that would apply to the fully grown mightyena
                on her trail.
            </p>
            <p>
                So she continued running. Deeper, further into the woods, than she had ever gone before. Past the spot where Luke and her
                once camped out to watch for shooting stars. Past the wooden signage local patrolmen had nailed to a ring
                of trees, denoting the boundaries of their patrol and advising caution. Past Miradeth, the old, massive willow
                tree that up till that moment had been at the edge of her entire known universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                All around her, the forest echoed with phantom sounds; the odd rustle of leaves, the snapping of twigs. Mallory had long
                lost track of what sounds belonged to her pursuer and what did not. All she knew was that she could not stop
                moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                She came to a halt only when her body finally gave out, legs burning and feeling like heavy, dead pieces of lead. By now,
                she had been running for hours. She knew because the sun had long set, and the moon was now high in the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mallory’s mind, however, was still racing. She had no idea how piece together the reality of what she had witnessed with
                her preconceived notions of the world. It just did not make sense. Luke was gone, and now his starter Pokemon
                showed up, crazy and feral? How? Why? Part of her wanted to go back, to prove to herself that this was just
                all one big nightmare, that she had just imagined all of this craziness. Napa was one of the friendliest,
                most loyal Pokemon she knew. He wouldn’t attack her for no reason, would he? No...
            </p>
            <p>
                He wouldn’t, she told herself repeatedly, curling up into a ball at the foot of an oak tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                He wouldn’t…
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="separator"></div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mallory wasn’t sure how long she’d slept, but the instant her eyes jerked open she was sure she was no longer alone. It was
                still in the dark of night, but the two dots of light glinting at her from the bushes were enough for her
                to know that Napa had found her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh Napa, thank god you’ve come,” she murmured, raising herself to a sitting position. “I had the most horrible dream…”
            </p>
            <p>
                The end was thankfully fast, with Mallory almost welcoming the her killer as the mightyena sank its fangs into her neck.
                She lost sensation in all her limbs, but as she drifted into unconsciousness, she felt strangely at peace.
                She recalled the time her brother took her to the beach, playing among the waves, watching the water crash
                into her ankles as she stood on the shore.That had been a good day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps Napa was taking her to Luke. Maybe she should not have run after all. In her mind, Luke was running ahead, his wild
                mop of hair peppered with sand as waves receded in the distance. The sun burned bright above them. Luke turned,
                smiling, reaching his hand out to her, and she raised her own to meet his.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">I’m sorry I took so long to find you, big brother. But I’m so happy I did.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the last thought she had.
            </p>

            <p>
                [Red]
            </p>
            <p>
                Viridian, The Emerald City, stands out proudly amidst a sea of greenery encroaching from every direction. Sitting at the
                western edge of what most historians would recognize as original Kanto, it is surrounded on all sides by
                a ten-foot tall circular stone wall, erected in a time long past as a defence against the frequent onslaught
                of monsters from the mountain ranges nested just beyond Kanto’s western border. These days, defensive measures
                are thankfully more sophisticated, with the divisions of patrolmen stationed in the area doing periodic sweeps,
                and manning a forward defensive perimeter near Mt. Silver and Mt. Bronze.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, maintenance of the walls is tradition, and tradition rarely needs reason to persist. A small army of volunteers take
                turns cleaning, polishing, and repairing any crumbling parts of the wall throughout the year, as a matter
                of city pride more than anything else. The result, though, is a pristine, matte-grey facade of grandeur,
                the sides of which are impressively free of any vines or weeds crawling up on either side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I join the main path out of the forest leading up to Viridian’s south gate at about two hours past sunrise, and find myself
                in a rowdy queue of merchants, traders and travellers of many varieties, all hoping to do business and find
                good steals in Viridian’s marketplace. The tall walls provide some blessed relief from the piercing morning
                sun as I approach the gate, and I glimpse the patrolmen on guard duty scanning IDs and admitting travellers
                one-by-one.
            </p>
            <p>
                ID tagging is mandatory for settlements designated as Amber to Crimson levels under the <span class="thought-text">Kanto City Defence Initiative</span>, a
                policy meant to evaluate and provide appropriate security to all settlements against external threats. Viridian
                earns a consistently high threat score due to its proximity to the mountain ranges. ID tagging is meant to
                assist in recovery and response after an attack, allowing the patrolmen to efficiently and accurately assess
                any loss of life or property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cities are also allocated resources to build a defence, both in the form of patrolmen from the Regional Defence Force, as
                well as <span class="thought-text">City Guardians</span>, exceptionally skilled civilian Pokemon-Trainer teams that have been recognized and
                awarded with a city contract, pledging the Pokemon to the defence of the city should the need ever arise.
                I know for a fact that Viridian always has at least two Guardians on-call at any one time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu trails along at the side of the path, decidedly uncomfortable with the swarm of humans in such close proximity to
                himself. He is understandably still wary of others in general, but thankfully has not been openly hostile
                to anyone since we came out of the forest. I had been incredibly nervous of what his reaction would be when
                we made contact with other people, and impressed on him repeatedly, with all the spoken commands and hand
                signs I could think of, that he was not to attack anyone or anything without clear instruction from me. Pikachu
                just yawned with an air of indifference at my insistent gestures, and I was left to wonder if it was due
                to ignorance or apathy that he was ignoring me. Polo, meanwhile, is walking at my side, eyes wide as he takes
                in the sights and sounds of his new surroundings, white, leathery hands clapping periodically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Directly in front of me, I cannot help but overhear a large, grizzled male, dressed entirely in militia garb, talking animatedly
                with his companion, a similarly dressed woman of petite stature.
            </p>
            <p>
                “...So, I told him, I’d pay to see Frowrakich make a monkey outta you! HAHA!” he bellows, taking a large bite out of a rice
                ball.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Tsk, honestly. Taunting Roan like that? You know it won’t be the first stupid idea he’s carried out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yea, but to see him get in the ring with that mankey? That’s a show deserving of front-row seats, believe me,” he grins
                at her, while she rolls her eyes in response.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, kid! That’s a sweet looking poliwhirl you got there! It got a name?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I realise the man has noticed Polo and is talking to me, angling his wide, toothy smile in my direction, flecks of rice dotting
                his beard. <span class="thought-text">Wow, he has a lotta teeth.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                “Uh, it’s name is Polo.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Could one mouth really fit that many teeth?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                “Gravy! Listen, in the outskirts of the city, near the northern gate, some of us patrolmen gather while off-duty to do a
                little sparring between Pokemon,” he says, jabbing a finger at his chest. “You’re more than welcome to join
                with that poliwhirl.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The Poliwrath line is more suited to physical combat than most other water Pokemon. After their initial stage as a limbless
                poliwag, they gradually develop impressively strong arms and legs to help propel them under water. Their
                skin and muscles are extremely durable, having evolved to handle the immense pressures of deep sea environments.
                This durability makes them physical powerhouses on land as well, in both offensive and defensive departments.
                Polo himself has started to build up significant power, I think, having spent a good deal of time exploring
                the deep in the lakes and rivers around Pallet.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Marc, stop bothering strangers with your nonsense,” the woman pipes in, before turning to me with a friendly smile, “but
                in this case, what he’s saying is correct, though. Our little sparring matches have actually become somewhat
                of a local event, with many resident trainers joining in. It’s a nice way for everybody to blow off some
                steam after a long day.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I see. Uh, just out of curiosity, are all Pokemon allowed to fight?” I ask, glancing towards my yellow-furred teammate in
                the grass, busy scratching his ears with his hind legs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The man follows my eyes to Pikachu. “Ah, well, see...It’s kind of only a physical fighting moves only contest, so I’m afraid
                that limits the type of Pokemon that can join,” he replies, shrugging apologetically, “Some things can’t
                mix. Like putting pineapple in curry.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ah...that’s fine,” I tell him, “I’d love to check it out when I have the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We make small talk until we reach the front of the line. Marc, and his partner, Sasha, I come to know, are part of the militia
                force garrisoned in Route 1, on a rocky outcropping overlooking the Tohjo Falls which separate Johto and
                Kanto. Many of their squad come to Viridian on their off days to stock up on supplies as well as to enjoy
                the amenities provided by the city. I learn that both Marc and Sasha hail from inland towns, with Marc coming
                from Johto’s Ecruteak, and Sasha originally from Cerise Town, near Saffron. Marc, Sasha tells me, has a somewhat
                obsessive relationship with food, and cannot seem to keep food-related references out of his speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I can’t even keep food-related objects outta my mouth!” he says, laughing heartily.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are impressed when I tell them of my plans to complete the entire Kanto gym circuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ah, to be young again,” Sasha says, cocking her head to the side with a grin.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I was on my way to becoming Champion once,” Marc says, through another mouthful of rice, “but I found my calling with the
                Defence Force - ”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You joined the Force because three years into adventuring you’d only earned two Johto badges and were flat broke, Marc,”
                Sasha corrects him, rolling her eyes once again.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh. Right. What can I say, Johto gyms are hard!”
            </p>
            <p>
                I decide that I like them. As we finally enter the gate, I bid farewell to them with promises of seeking them out soon, and
                turn my attention to Viridian City proper. To say the city was busy would be an understatement. It is a hub
                teeming with life, hordes of people bustling around as they go about their daily activities. The main boulevard
                from the south gate leads me right to the city square, where all kinds of shops and makeshift stalls have
                been set up, peddling goods or Pokemon to anyone who might be interested. Row after row of cloth sheets have
                been laid out, with all manner of items on display. Homemade berry tonics, good-luck charms, and even what
                are claimed to be charizard teeth, are just some of the merchandise I see for sale.
            </p>
            <p>
                And amidst the crowd, there are Pokemon too. Various jynx, swaying their bipedal forms to music, hold out signs inviting
                people to browse their owner’s stalls. Taillow and pidgey fly overhead, carrying baskets, presumably delivering
                goods to customers. There is even an abra messaging service booth available, allowing customers telepathic
                communication with anyone in areas with unreliable satellite reception. It has always been curious to me
                how eagerly we humans subjugate that which we fear. Outside townships, arcanine are to be avoided at all
                costs, with the threat of death by mauling, yet inside, an identical arcanine could be called on to give
                children rides around the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way I squat down, motion for Pikachu to ride on my bag, and he hops on without complaint. While I would not, by
                any means, say that Pikachu considers me to be a place of safety, I was certainly more familiar to him than
                this loud, aggressive, alien world of human commerce.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shopping, though, is not on my mind just yet. First, I need to decide on where I will be staying.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes me the better part of an hour to find a suitable (cheap) motel for us to spend the night, in a quieter, less frequented
                part of the city. The facilities are sparse and plain, but that suits me just fine. As I enter my room and
                shut the door behind me, however, I suddenly feel Pikachu get incredibly fidgety on my back. He leaps off
                and bounds around the room, growing increasingly agitated. He comes to a stop in the center of the room,
                snapping his head back and forth, eyes wide and dilated with fear. The realisation hits me, that this must
                be the first time Pikachu has ever set foot inside a human dwelling. I remember from trainer school that
                Pokemon who’ve lived exclusively in the wild often find human buildings to be disorienting at first; they
                often need to be slowly eased into their new environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaching Pikachu slowly, speaking in low, bass tones thought to be more calming on a primal level, I assure him that everything’s
                okay. Polo runs to Pikachu, stroking his fur, making concerned noises, and Pikachu reflexively lets loose
                a electric shock at him. Polo, to his full credit, flinches but does not back away; he senses Pikachu’s distress
                and stays by his side. I go to the far side of the room and slide open the curtains and window panes, revealing
                the view of the tree-lined walkways outside and letting the sounds of nature filter into the room. At the
                sight of this, Pikachu calms down, running to the window to crane his neck outside, as if the world would
                disappear should he fail to keep it in view.
            </p>
            <p>
                I let Pikachu stay there for some time more, letting him get used to this foreign environment. It is a somewhat comical sight,
                his lower body dangling freely from the windowsill while his front paws and head poke out, and after amusing
                myself for a few moments, I drag my bedside table over to his spot to give him some support to stand on.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Pikachu settles down, I bring him and Polo over to the local Pokemon Centre to rid them of their most serious wounds
                (mainly Pikachu’s). It takes a while, as I have to convince Pikachu to stop trying to scratch the nurse as
                she applies various salves and ointments before she wheels him further in for a more thorough healing treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, I take out my pokedex and check for any messages from the Professor. It turns out he does have an update
                for me - the first of my stipends as a research assistant has been cleared and transacted to my account,
                leaving me with far more money than I have ever owned, along with a request for any preliminary feedback
                on the device so far. I take some time to write a reply, and by the time I am done I am already planning
                how to spend all the money I have just received.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being a trainer is expensive business, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Potions, antidotes, burn and paralysis heals for Pokemon all cost upwards of hundreds of zennies, not even counting all the
                pokeballs needed to build up your pokemon team. For perspective, after working a year as a part-time ranch-hand
                for Professor Oak, I’d saved up 700 odd zennies, barely enough to pay for a domesticated starter and some
                camping supplies. Stories of trainers having to abandon their journey due to cash flow problems are not uncommon,
                and so most trainers must worry about finding sources of income during their travels. The research stipends
                are nice, but only amount to about a thousand zennies every month; passable for purchasing basic necessities
                but not much else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Officially, every settlement can put up Association-sanctioned <span class="thought-text">trainer contracts</span> that trainers can sign up to do for a reward,
                usually consisting of tasks requiring trained Pokemon assistance, officiated and administered by the Association
                branch in that area. However, such tasks are by no means a guarantee in every town, not to mention that some
                tasks will have highly specific requirements not every trainer will be able to meet. Pokemon trade is also
                a possible income source, with traders paying varying prices depending on the rarity and quality of the Pokemon
                in question. An equally viable option is harvesting Pokemon parts, such as swellow eggs and venomoth scales,
                to be sold to apothecaries or as collector items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Realistically, I think my best bet will be to work on the last two options. The difficulty and payout of contracts are notoriously
                erratic, and unless there’s a power generator somewhere that happens to be busted and needs a temporary Pika-powered
                replacement, I do not think my Pokemon will be fulfilling any contract requirements anytime soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heading out just after midday, I do what any self-respecting penniless person would do - bypass the large departmental stores
                and go straight for the bargain section of the flea market. Navigating the crowded streets is a challenge,
                but I manage. Polo is already at ease with crowds of people so I let him walk with me, and Pikachu rides
                perched on my shoulders, with his head peeking over my cap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding the market, I make sure not to fall prey to the mistake many novice trainers make - focusing too much on expensive
                poke-items. Instead, the most important things on my shopping list are stocking up on precious rations and
                camping gear. According to incident statistics, most trainer deaths do not actually result from wild pokebattles;
                they fall either due to untreated injury, dehydration or starvation. So, needless to say, I plan to be as
                prepared as possible in that regard. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend my remaining money on an assortment of pokeballs and antidotes,
                as I know there are plenty of bug Pokemon with poison capabilities in Viridian Woods. Before I know it, the
                better part of the afternoon is gone, my bank account is depleted, and my bag is satisfyingly full with much
                needed supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wandering the main thoroughfares with no real direction, watching as the city winds down with the dying sun, I find myself
                nearing the western gate and see that which gives Viridian City its second, but equally applicable, title
                - the Gateway to the Indigo Plateau. The Viridian West Gate, separating Viridian City and route 22, is a
                path which every Kanto trainer planning on challenging the Elite Four must go through to reach the plateau.
                Adorned with bronze rhydon statues on either side of the gate, a tribute to Ishkar, the first Grand Champion,
                and his prized Pokemon, the louvred wooden gate stands tall and distinct from its three other counterparts
                leading out of the city. The main walkway here is lined with rows of flowers and immaculately trimmed hedges,
                as if ready for a grand procession to pass through any moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, the city elders chanced upon the idea of turning the passage of challengers through their city into an event, building
                up fanfare and pomp to turn it into a sort of local attraction. And the locals have certainly taken to the
                spectacle. Closed for most of the week, every seventh day, at midday, the gate opens and remains so until
                the sun finally sets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a ceremony of the largest order, and hordes of locals and tourists gather to
                take pictures and cheer for said challengers before they set off. Scores of enterprising traders traverse
                the crowds, selling their wares, while challengers go around shaking hands, meeting fans, networking. Being
                a successful trainer is as much about marketing yourself as it is about battle prowess. It helps, of course,
                that many people would jump at the chance to say they met the Grand Champion before he became Champion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around me, city wardens begin to light candles in the street lamps. Electric power would be reserved for essential services
                and buildings closer to the city centre, both for the sake of power conservation and to avoid agitating any
                Pokemon populations in the vicinity. The lamps cast a soft orange glow on the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu hops off my shoulders and stretches his legs, glad to walk on his own now that the crowds have thinned. Turning to
                my right, I decide to follow the path along the walls, trailing the city perimeter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I soon come across a double storey compound with a grey facade, isolated, standing apart from the rest of the city. I realise
                I have, unbeknownst to me, stumbled upon the Viridian City Gym. The only lights emanating from the building
                are the small indicator lights outside the main entrance, flashing a weak red. I glance at the darkened windows.
                Nobody’s home. Not that I am surprised. Out of all the Kanto gyms, Viridian’s has proven the least popular.
                Not least because of the current gym leader Giovanni’s determination to spend the as little time as possible
                present at the gym, only fulfilling the minimum required hours, but also because of his casual disregard
                of custom. Not relegating his gym roster to a single type, he instead puts forth his entire championship-tier
                team, only awarding the Earth Badge to those who manage to defeat at least half of his roster. These two
                factors combined means that trainer-hopefuls who wish to collect the eight badges required would rather take
                detours to Johto to earn some of the easier badges there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, a gym is a gym, and it is the first one I have come across. The entrance is made up of a pair of steel doors, unburnished
                and spotted with years of water damage. Where one would expect a fancy handle of some sort, there is only
                a square shaft of blackened metal. Placing my hand on the cold door, I try and put myself in the shoes of
                the countless challengers who have come before me. What did they feel as they came to challenge this notoriously
                unforgiving gym? Were they hopeful? Excited? Did they come just for the experience, to view a championship
                team up close?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">*Click*</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The sudden sound jolts me out of my reverie. With a start, I realise that the door is swinging open, pushed inwards by my
                weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Not locked? Impossible. The Association guidelines on gym operations in the event of leader absence are clear…</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, the evidence before me is undeniable. A small part of me is scandalised at the impropriety of it all, but that part
                is easily overpowered by my curiosity, smothered and shoved into a small lockbox in a corner of my mind,
                to be taken out at some later date.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Surely there’s no harm in just a peek. To see a gym stage up close…</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Peering in, I see a long, dark corridor, the only illumination coming from the faint moonlight pouring through the windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Okay, then. Just a quick look.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                I slowly make my way down the passage, footsteps echoing down the hallway. Pikachu throws my boots an irritated glance as
                he and Polo trot noiselessly along. Abashed, I start keeping to my heels to lessen the noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the inactivity, the place seems pristinely maintained. Not a speck of dirt is present on the marbled floors. Before
                long, I come to the end of the walkway, which opens up to a reception area. The pale moonlight reveals a
                stone Giovanni bust on a standing dais in the centre of the room, which I almost do not recognize. Half its
                face is gone, sheared clean off from the top of the bust’s forehead, past the nose, down to its left cheek.
                Several stone fragments are visible on the floor. With how neat and orderly everything else has been, this
                particular scene is downright strange.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, Pikachu hisses towards the dais, ears twitching rapidly. Piiiiika. Hearing the shuffling of footsteps, I realise
                there is a figure approaching, moonlight revealing two legs in grey jeans.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ah, sorry about entering,” I start, putting on my most contrite expression, “the door was open and I couldn’t help myself...”.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that is all I have time for as the figure suddenly lets out a heart-pounding roar, arms swinging out in a horizontal
                arc, sweeping aside the dais, bust flying through the air to crash into the far wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu is suddenly in front of me, snarling, sending a powerful shockwave towards the figure. In the flash of lightning,
                I see the terrible truth - not a person in grey, but a machoke, its muscled upper body rippling with strength
                and fury. Pikachu peppers the creature with shock after shock, but still the machoke moves forward, its thick
                hide providing resistance against the electric attacks. It aims an overhead fist at Pikachu but he darts
                away, a shower of rubble thrown up in the air as the strike shatters the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                I stumble back instinctively, lizard brain in full control, screaming at me to flee or die.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">RUN.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">No, it’s too close!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The machoke swipes forward with an outstretched hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Need a more powerful shock to bring it down.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu is caught this time and is sent flying back, but the machoke’s hand does not stop, and I realise too late that I
                am in the way -
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing I know, the machoke’s hand is wrapped around my throat, squeezing, lifting me several feet above the floor.
                For an instant our eyes meet, I see that they are almost entirely bleach-white, irises narrowed to two pin
                prick dots. I lash out in vain as I gasp for breath. A sudden howl of anger and movement near the bottom
                of my vision draws my attention, however, and I realise Polo is there, attempting to pry me out of the machoke’s
                grip. After a few moments he changes tack, delivering a series of punches that connect solidly with the machoke’s
                torso. This is the first time I have seen him attack another Pokemon willingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The machoke staggers but stays upright, and he retaliates instantly with a swipe of his free hand, sending Polo reeling.
                Machoke have been known to train relentlessly in mountain passes and construction yards, building strength
                and endurance by lifting the heaviest objects they can find. Polo unfortunately lacks the raw strength needed
                to subdue such a creature. Still, Polo keeps it up, fueling his assault with newfound vigour and determination.
            </p>
            <p>
                My vision blurs, body jerking as my lungs struggle for nonexistent oxygen, but despite that my heart fills with pride.The
                poliwhirl, previously known only for its meekness, was intent on protecting his trainer from the superpowered
                beast. <span class="thought-text">By the legendaries, I am proud of you, Polo.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                My eyes widen in realisation. <span class="thought-text">Polo.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                My arms strain with all their might as they pull on the machoke’s grip. It is like straining against bars of iron.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wa...te...er…”
            </p>
            <p>
                Every heartbeat now brings on a fresh spike of agony as I try to force the words out, tears pooling in my eyes from the effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sp...o...out”
            </p>
            <p>
                I just barely manage to croak out the last syllable as Polo finally backs up and lets loose a torrent of water, aimed up
                like a fountain, drenching the machoke in the cascade. I do not have breath nor strength left in me for the
                next command, but thankfully I do not need to. As if on cue, a massive thunderbolt crashes into the creature,
                with force so great I swear I feel a physical tremor. Aided by the water, the machoke now conducts the electricity
                beautifully, like harmonious chords plucked together and amplified by a thousand, melding into a single,
                destructive note of annihilation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thought-text">Sing for me, you asshole.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                It lets out a blood curdling roar once more, but this time, it is one of pain. As the machoke’s nervous system fries, its
                muscles start to tense up, and for a split, dreadful instant, I worry all I have done is hasten my own death
                warrant. But Polo is ready for me, pummeling the machoke’s arm and wrist joints, breaking me out of its vice-like
                grip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally free from its clutches, I collapse to the ground beside the fallen Pokemon, gulping in mouthfuls of air and nursing
                my injured windpipe. I savour the oxygen with blessed relief, feeling it envelope my lungs like a sweet,
                rich, life-giving nectar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu, fortunately unhurt, bounds over to me and gives me a cursory look-over. Evidently satisfied that I am not going
                to die, he shifts his attention to the machoke, circling and sniffing at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I trust Pikachu’s survival instincts, and assume from his now calm demeanor that we are not under any immediate threat. Still,
                I do not want to linger here any longer than I already have. I have dreadfully miscalculated my little nighttime
                adventure. Taking out one of my recently acquired pokeballs, I catch the paralyzed machoke and shove it onto
                my belt clip. I can deal with it later. I gather my pack, which dropped onto the floor in the struggle, and
                hastily make my way to the exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enough excitement for one night, I think.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning, I pace the streets deep in thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, whenever you buy pokeballs, at least from any licensed retailer, you have to register your trainer identification on
                the chip inside. As you catch Pokemon, the pokeball automatically tags the pokemon with your ID, providing
                a way to identify the Pokemon that you as a trainer have caught. You also cannot capture a Pokemon with prior
                ID tags, unless the trainer specifically de-registers that Pokemon from his roster.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are, of course, exceptions, for example if that Pokemon has not returned to its pokeball for an extended duration of
                time. Then, the ID tag would expire and the Pokemon would be considered wild again. This is to account for
                irresponsible trainers, who set their Pokemon free without going through the proper procedures. Without this
                measure, abandoned Pokemon who had been caught once could never be caught again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier, I checked the trainer registration of the machoke using my pokedex. Its current trainer was listed as me, which
                was expected, but before me, there was a single entry, meaning the machoke had belonged to someone else previously.
                That by itself was not particularly unusual, only...the trainer name and ID were listed as unreadable. It
                was a curious thing. I had never heard of such data becoming corrupted. Perplexed, I sent a message to Professor
                Oak asking if he had any insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other issue at hand was the machoke itself. The Machamp line in general is incredibly genial, its Pokemon interacting
                and assimilating into human society with great ease. There have been stories of wild machop and machoke going
                down to construction sites and helping builders for free, if for no other reason than to train. I could not
                think of a single incident where a machoke attacked a human unprovoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you could very well point Pikachu out as a prime example of an aggressive outlier, and you would not be wrong.
                Yet, this machoke’s aggression seemed different. More...focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had gone to the police station to report the assault first thing this morning. Since this attack happened within city limits,
                it would be considered police jurisdiction. Standing in a wide line in the station yard, with a trio of growlithe
                and a single arcanine keeping guard, the lieutenant bade me release the machoke before them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The machoke materialized in front of them, laying in the same position as he’d been in the night before. It stood up slowly
                as it gradually shook of the effects of the paralysis and shocks. For a brief, tense moment, nothing else
                happened. Then the machoke reared its head up with those white alien eyes, and I knew we were not safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Look ou-” I went to shout, but the machoke was already in motion, charging past the row of growlithe before they could do
                anything to react. It was only thanks to the extremespeed of the arcanine that the sergeant closest to the
                machoke didn’t get his head separated from his body, the arcanine tackling it to the ground just in front
                of the lawman. The machoke, frothing at the mouth, still put up a fight, nearly bucking the arcanine right
                off, until I had the presence of mind to return it to its pokeball.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up leaving the machoke with them and giving my full statement, and they promised a full investigation, as well as
                to update me on any significant progress on the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking back on the incident, it seemed obvious. This machoke’s unexplainable grudge was somehow solely against humans,
                and it would drive itself into a berserk rage upon seeing one, attacking them and any others that got in
                its way. But how did it get like that? Did its past trainer have anything to do with it? Certainly, mistreatment
                of Pokemon could turn some hostile towards humans, but rarely would they develop such vitriol. And those
                eyes. Were those natural? My gut told me there was more to this than there seemed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sudden commotion jolts me from my reverie. Looking around, I notice I have wandered away from the busy market streets into
                a less populated, more spacious part of the city. In the distance, a modestly large group of people are gathered
                in a rough circle. My curiosity is piqued. As I move closer, I see that they are in fact watching Pokemon
                fight in a crudely drawn circular arena.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey! Red!” A figure amidst the crowd waves to me. It’s Marc! I realise my aimless walking has led me to the sparring matches
                that Sasha and him mentioned the day before. Waving back, I walk up to the group, Polo and Pikachu in tow.
                Sasha reaches out and pulls me into the crowd, affording me a front row seat at the ongoing duel.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is an impressive sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the circle currently stands the largest, fiercest mankey I have ever seen. Standing at nearly a metre tall, wiry muscles
                obvious under a coat of white, shaggy fur, it could have passed for a small primeape if not for the primeape’s
                distinct glove-like hands. Standing across from it in the same arena is a smaller, but no less intense, mankey,
                both circling each other and rippling with energy and aggression.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The big one’s called Frowrakich,” Sasha whispers, “It’s belongs to Jean over there and is undefeated still. The lads are
                placing big bets to see who will be the first one to unseat him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The smaller mankey beats on its chest repeatedly and stomps on the ground, the way mankey do to gather their rage for an
                attack. Both breathe in short, rapid bursts. From the corner of my eye, I notice Pikachu’s ears flick once
                before the mankey lunges forward with a war-cry, running forward in wide, zig-zag motions, seemingly intent
                on tackling Frowrakich from the side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frowrakich’s reaction is instant, pivoting on a single foot to sidestep the opponent’s tackle, using its forward momentum
                and a well placed karate chop to send the attacking mankey crashing into the ground. In the blink of an eye,
                Frowrakich has the smaller mankey in a stranglehold. It is a sublime sequence, with almost no wasted movement.
                After a few moments of struggling, the opposing trainer taps out to a smattering round of applause.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pikachu keeps his eyes on Frowrakich as he makes his way back to Jean, a slim-built man wearing a fedora hat. Polo just claps
                gaily along, probably to fit in with the rest of the crowd, I think.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Damn you Jean, I’ll get the better of your monkey, just you wait,” the losing trainer calls out.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I will, gancho,” Jean replies, a smile playing on his tanned, weathered face, “In the meantime, I will just be collecting
                my winnings from you, yes?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I exhale a stream of air out through pursed lips.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That was certainly...remarkable,” I say, “I’ve never seen a mankey that skilled.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Marc, chewing on some vespiquen-honeyed candy, lets out a hearty laugh.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Thrilling, ain’t it, kid?” he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so, I settle down to watch several other matches play out. It seems that trainers have gathered from everywhere, and
                we see nidorino, tyrogue, even the odd heracross or two, in addition to many more mankey held by the locals.
                Mankey are a popular choice here, Sasha tells me, because of how common they are around the outskirts of
                Viridian.
            </p>
            <p>
                The matches end in a variety of ways, I realise. The most common one is what Frowrakich demonstrated, knocking your opponent
                into submission, forcing a tap out, but a win also can result from forcing your opponent out of the bounds
                of the arena. There is a time limit as well, with a draw being declared if the match goes on for more than
                three minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a particularly fierce match between a tyrogue and combusken, with the combusken eventually yielding to the seemingly
                endless flurry of bullet punches from the opponent, Marc leans over and nudges me in the shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, Red,” he says, cocking his head in Polo’s direction, “think you’re ready for a match of your own?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I look over at Polo. Like the rest of us, he has been watching the matches intently.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Whaddya say, Polo,” I ask softly, “wanna give it a shot?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Pwoo, he say, standing up. His fists are clenched, eyes determined. Years ago, I had deemed Polo unsuitable for combat due
                to his unwillingness to attack other Pokemon. But perhaps all he needed was some encouragement and a little
                near-death scrape to get him riled up. Either way, since the event last night I sensed a new spark
                in him - no, a fire - just waiting to be let out. I smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll do it, I tell Marc.
